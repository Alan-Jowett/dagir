This repository uses GitHub Copilot and the GitHub Copilot coding agent guidance.

Guidance for contributors:
- Keep responses concise and focused on code changes.
- Do not commit generated large transformations without a human review.
- When asked to modify repository files, ensure tests still pass locally.

If you are a maintainer, include these steps in PR descriptions when asking Copilot to modify files:
- Which files to change.
- A concise spec of why the change is needed.
- Any tests or formatting checks to run after changes.
